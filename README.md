# Sports Management System

A NestJS backend API for managing sports classes. Includes user registration, authentication, role-based access control, and class management.

## Tech Stack

- **NestJS** (TypeScript, Express)
- **PostgreSQL** with **TypeORM**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **Swagger API Documentation**
- **Role-based Authorization**
- **Integration & Unit Testing**
- **pgAdmin4** for DB management

---

### Reason for these technologies
- **PostgreSQL**: Strong relational structure for users <-> classes <-> applicants.
- **TypeORM**: Full decorator and DI support for NestJS. Clean integration.
- **NestJS**: Modular, testable, and scalable structure ideal for APIs.
- **Swagger**: Auto-generated docs improve API understanding and onboarding.
- **bcrypt + JWT**: Secure authentication with encrypted passwords and token-based access.
> I considered Prisma and MongoDB, but for this relational setup, TypeORM with Postgres was the better fit.

### Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram
Below is a simplified view of the relational structure:

![ER Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3604a81b-0ec0-4807-9970-e24d8550c0d5)
> Diagram created using [draw.io](https://draw.io) and stored in `/docs`.

This diagram illustrates the core data structure:
- user: Represents registered users. Each user can apply for multiple sport classes.
- sport_class: Represents a scheduled class for a specific sport. Each class contains details like title, schedule, and creator.
- user_applied_classes_sport_class: This is a join table automatically created by TypeORM to manage the many-to-many relationship between users and sport classes. It connects:
  - userId -> user.id
  - sportClassId -> sport_class.id

In short:
- A user can apply to many sport classes.
- A sport class can have many users.
- Admins manage sport classes, users apply to them.

### Installed Packages
Authentication & Authorization
```bash
npm install @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport passport passport-jwt bcrypt
npm install --save-dev @types/passport-jwt @types/bcrypt
```
- **@nestjs/jwt** - Lets you sign and verify JWT tokens inside NestJS services
- **@nestjs/passport, passport, passport-jwt** - Passport strategies for JWT
- **bcrypt** - Used to hash passwords before saving and to compare at login
- **@types/\*** â€“ TypeScript support

Database & Environment
```bash
npm install @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg
npm install @nestjs/config
```
- **@nestjs/typeorm** - Integrates TypeORM into NestJS
- **pg** - PostgreSQL driver lets your app talk to Postgres
- **@nestjs/config** - Used for environment support

Validation & Transformation
```bash
npm install class-validator class-transformer
```
- **class-validator** - Adds decorators like @IsEmail(), @MinLength(). Validating input
- **class-transformer** - Transforms raw JSON into class instances automatically. Enabling decorators

API Documentation
```bash
npm install @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express
```
- **@nestjs/swagger**		Builder for API docs
- **swagger-ui-express**	Viewer for API docs
